# How to contribute

Everyone is welcome to get involved and every contribution counts.

Make sure that your code is PEP8 compliant. Every new piece of code should be properly tested and reviewed.

## The process

- If don't have write access, please fork the repo and make merge request with changes afterwards.
  [Detailed tutorial of forking workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/forking_workflow.html)
- If you have at least developer access, create branch and merge request afterwards.
  (prefix with `WIP:` when its not ready to merge)

Once you have your merge request ready, ask a responsible person of repository for a code review.

If you leave some of non-crucial discussions unresolved, create an issue for resolving them later.

Write your changes to [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) which follows the [https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/](keepachangelog)
guide.
